To solve for the conditional probability of an adult woman owning a car given that the percentage of adults who are women and own a car is 20%, we need to use the concept of conditional probability. Let’s break it down step-by-step.

### Problem Setup
- **Given**: The percentage of adults who are both women and own a car is 20%, i.e., \( P(\text{Woman} \cap \text{Car}) = 0.20 \).
- **To Find**: The conditional probability that an adult is a car owner given that they are a woman, i.e., \( P(\text{Car} | \text{Woman}) \).
- **Formula for Conditional Probability**:
  \[
  P(\text{Car} | \text{Woman}) = \frac{P(\text{Woman} \cap \text{Car})}{P(\text{Woman})}
  \]
  Here, \( P(\text{Woman} \cap \text{Car}) \) is the joint probability of being a woman and owning a car, and \( P(\text{Woman}) \) is the probability that an adult is a woman.

### Issue: Missing Information
- We know \( P(\text{Woman} \cap \text{Car}) = 0.20 \), but the problem does not provide \( P(\text{Woman}) \), the probability that an adult is a woman.
- Without \( P(\text{Woman}) \), we cannot compute \( P(\text{Car} | \text{Woman}) \) directly, as it’s needed in the denominator.

### Reasonable Assumption
To proceed, we need an estimate for \( P(\text{Woman}) \). A common assumption in probability problems involving adults is that the population is roughly evenly split by gender unless specified otherwise. Let’s assume:
- \( P(\text{Woman}) \approx 0.5 \) (50% of adults are women).
This is a simplifying assumption, and in real-world scenarios, you’d need actual demographic data (e.g., from a census or survey).

### Calculation
Using the conditional probability formula:
\[
P(\text{Car} | \text{Woman}) = \frac{P(\text{Woman} \cap \text{Car})}{P(\text{Woman})}
\]
- Substitute the known values:
  \[
  P(\text{Car} | \text{Woman}) = \frac{0.20}{0.5} = 0.4
  \]
- Convert to percentage:
  \[
  0.4 \times 100\% = 40\%
  \]

### Interpretation
- The probability that an adult woman owns a car is 40%, assuming that 50% of adults are women.
- This means that among women, 40% are car owners based on the given joint probability and our assumption.

### Caveats
- **Assumption Dependency**: The result depends on \( P(\text{Woman}) = 0.5 \). If the actual proportion of women in the population differs (e.g., 48% or 52%), the answer changes. For example:
  - If \( P(\text{Woman}) = 0.4 \):
    \[
    P(\text{Car} | \text{Woman}) = \frac{0.20}{0.4} = 0.5 = 50\%
    \]
  - If \( P(\text{Woman}) = 0.6 \):
    \[
    P(\text{Car} | \text{Woman}) = \frac{0.20}{0.6} \approx 0.333 = 33.3\%
    \]
- **Context**: In a real-world P&C insurance scenario (e.g., for a Python developer role), you might use survey data or insurance records to estimate \( P(\text{Woman}) \). For instance, a dataset might provide the proportion of women among insured adults.

### Python Code to Illustrate
Here’s a simple Python script to compute the conditional probability, allowing for different values of \( P(\text{Woman}) \):

```python
# Python Script: Conditional Probability of Car Ownership Given Woman
# Calculates P(Car | Woman) given P(Woman and Car) = 0.20

# Step 1: Define given probability
p_woman_and_car = 0.20  # Joint probability P(Woman ∩ Car)

# Step 2: Assume P(Woman) (probability an adult is a woman)
p_woman = 0.5  # Assumption: 50% of adults are women

# Step 3: Calculate conditional probability P(Car | Woman)
p_car_given_woman = p_woman_and_car / p_woman

# Step 4: Print result
print(f"P(Woman and Car): {p_woman_and_car * 100}%")
print(f"Assumed P(Woman): {p_woman * 100}%")
print(f"P(Car | Woman): {p_car_given_woman * 100:.1f}%")

# Optional: Test with different P(Woman) values
p_woman_alt = 0.4
p_car_given_woman_alt = p_woman_and_car / p_woman_alt
print(f"\nIf P(Woman) = {p_woman_alt * 100}%:")
print(f"P(Car | Woman): {p_car_given_woman_alt * 100:.1f}%")
```

**Output**:
```
P(Woman and Car): 20.0%
Assumed P(Woman): 50.0%
P(Car | Woman): 40.0%

If P(Woman) = 40.0%:
P(Car | Woman): 50.0%
```

### Final Answer
The probability that an adult woman owns a car is **40%**, assuming that 50% of adults are women. If you have specific data for the proportion of women in the population, please provide it, and I can refine the calculation. Additionally, if you want to connect this to the annuity insurance or ball trajectory examples (e.g., modeling car ownership in P&C insurance risk), let me know!
