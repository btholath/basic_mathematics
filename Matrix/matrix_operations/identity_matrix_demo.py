. Identity Matrix
The identity matrix is a square matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere. It acts like the number 1 in multiplication, leaving other matrices unchanged when multiplied.

Business Context: In supply chain management, an identity matrix can represent a "no-transformation" scenario, such as direct passthrough of inventory levels without adjustments. This is useful for baseline forecasting or auditing systems where stakeholders need to verify that operations remain unchanged under neutral conditions.
ML Context: In neural networks (e.g., ResNet architectures), identity matrices are used in skip connections to preserve information across layers, preventing vanishing gradients and improving model training stability. This enhances interpretability by allowing stakeholders to trace how input features influence outputs without distortion.
