Linear Algebra

In linear algebra, these are the only options: one, no, infinite solutions.
it means, it is impossible for lines to cross multiple times.

Contemporary applications
- Solving for unknowns in ML algos, including deep learning
- Reducing dimensionality ( e.g., principal component analysis)
- Ranking results (e.g. with eigenvector)
- Recommenders (e.g., singular value decomposition, SVD)

Linear Algebra
- Sheriff has 180 km/h car
- Bank robber has 150 km/h car and 5 minute head start
- How long does it take the sheriff to catch the robber ?
- What distance will they have travelled at that point?

150 km/h = 2.5 km/min
180 km/h = 3 km/min
