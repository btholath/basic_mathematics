# 0) Algebra Foundation (optional refresher)

**Why for ML:** basic equation solving, function behavior, and manipulating expressions show up everywhere (loss functions, decision boundaries).

**Know:**

* Linear & quadratic functions; roots; vertex $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$
* Function composition $f(g(x))$, inverse functions
* Logs & exponents (for cross-entropy, likelihoods)

**Quick check (no code):**

1. Solve $3x+2=11$.
2. Vertex of $y=2x^2-8x+3$?
   **Answers:** 1) $x=3$. 2) $x= \frac{8}{4}=2$; $y=2(4)-16+3=-5$ ‚Üí vertex $(2,-5)$.

# 1) Calculus (rates, slopes, areas)

**Why for ML:** training = minimizing a loss by following its **gradient** (steepest descent). Integrals show up in expectations/areas.

**Know:**

* Derivatives: slope of $f(x)$, product/chain rules
* Common grads: $\frac{d}{dx}x^n = nx^{n-1}$, $\frac{d}{dx}e^x=e^x$, $\frac{d}{dx}\ln x = 1/x$
* Partial derivatives & gradient $\nabla f$
* Second derivative / Hessian ‚Üí curvature (convexity, Newton‚Äôs method)
* Integrals as area, expectations

**Tiny Python (gradient & gradient step):**

```python
import numpy as np

# Quadratic loss: f(w) = (w-3)^2  -> minimum at w=3
def f(w): return (w-3)**2
def df(w): return 2*(w-3)

w = 0.0
eta = 0.1
for _ in range(10):
    w -= eta * df(w)  # gradient descent step
print("w after 10 steps ‚âà", round(w, 4))  # should move toward 3
```

**Quick check:**

* If $f(w)=(w-5)^2$, what‚Äôs $\nabla f$ and the minimizer?
  **Answer:** $2(w-5)$; minimum at $w=5$.

---

# 2) Linear Algebra (vectors, matrices, geometry)

**Why for ML:** data are vectors; models are linear maps; embeddings, projections, PCA, attention all rely on matrix ops.

**Know:**

* Vector ops: dot $(a\cdot b)$ = similarity; norm $\|x\|$ = length
* Matrix multiply (composition of linear maps)
* Projections: ‚Äúshadow‚Äù of one vector on another
* Eigenvalues/eigenvectors: stable directions of a transform; PCA uses eigen-decomposition of covariance

**Core formulas:**

* Dot: $a\cdot b = \sum_i a_ib_i = \|a\|\|b\|\cos\theta$
* Projection of $x$ on $u$: $\text{proj}_u(x)=\frac{x\cdot u}{u\cdot u}u$

**Tiny Python (dot, projection, PCA intuition):**

```python
import numpy as np

x = np.array([2., 1.])
u = np.array([1., 0.])        # x-axis
proj = (x@u)/(u@u) * u        # projection of x onto u
print("dot(x,u)=", x@u, "projection=", proj)

# Covariance & principal direction (2D toy)
X = np.array([[1,2],[2,3],[3,5],[4,8]], dtype=float)
Xc = X - X.mean(axis=0, keepdims=True)
C = (Xc.T @ Xc) / (len(X)-1)
eigvals, eigvecs = np.linalg.eig(C)
print("largest eigenvector (PCA dir) =", eigvecs[:, eigvals.argmax()])
```

**Quick check:**

* If $a\cdot b=0$, what‚Äôs the geometric meaning?
  **Answer:** Vectors are orthogonal (90¬∞ apart).

---

# 3) Probability (uncertainty & evaluation)

**Why for ML:** predictions are uncertain; we choose models by likelihoods, use Bayes‚Äô rule, and evaluate with probabilistic metrics.

**Know:**

* Basics: events, independence, complement rule $P(A^c)=1-P(A)$
* Conditional prob: $P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$
* Bayes‚Äô theorem: $P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$
* Random variables; mean $\mathbb{E}[X]$, variance $\mathrm{Var}(X)$
* Distributions: Bernoulli/Binomial, Normal; Central Limit Theorem (intuition)

**Tiny Python (simulation intuition):**

```python
import numpy as np

# Bernoulli coin with p=0.6, estimate mean and variance empirically
p = 0.6
samples = np.random.rand(10000) < p
mean = samples.mean()
var = samples.var()
print("empirical mean‚âà", round(mean,3), "var‚âà", round(var,3), "theory var=p(1-p)=", p*(1-p))
```

**Quick check (Bayes):**

* 1% have a condition. Test is 99% sensitive, 95% specific. A positive test‚Äîwhat‚Äôs $P(\text{condition}|\text{positive})$?
  **Answer (setup):**
  $P(C)=0.01, P(+|C)=0.99, P(+|\neg C)=0.05$.
  $P(+)=0.99\cdot0.01 + 0.05\cdot0.99=0.0099+0.0495=0.0594$.
  $P(C|+)=0.0099/0.0594\approx 0.167$ (‚âà16.7%).

## üß© Practice set (bite-size)

1. Compute $\frac{d}{dx}(3x^2+4x-7)$.
2. For $f(w)=(w-2)^2+(w+1)^2$, find $w$ that minimizes $f$.
3. Given $x=(3,4)$, $\|x\|$ = ?
4. If two standardized features have dot product 0.9, what does it suggest?
5. Use Bayes‚Äô rule to compute $P(A|B)$ with $P(A)=0.2, P(B|A)=0.8, P(B)=0.5$.

**Answers:**

1. $6x+4$. 2) $f'(w)=2(w-2)+2(w+1)=4w-2\Rightarrow w=\frac{1}{2}$. 3) 5.
2. Strong positive alignment/correlation. 5) $0.8\cdot0.2/0.5=0.32$.

Use Git Large File Storage (Git LFS)
Git LFS is designed for versioning large files like datasets, models, or media.

üîß Step-by-Step Setup
Install Git LFS (if not already installed):

```bash
git lfs install
Track the large file:
```

```bash
git lfs track "Matrix/matrix-based-ml-techqniues/creditcard.csv"
Add the .gitattributes file created by LFS:
```

```bash
git add .gitattributes
Re-add the large file:
```

```bash
git add Matrix/matrix-based-ml-techqniues/creditcard.csv
git commit -m "Track large dataset with Git LFS"
git push origin main
```
üîó GitHub will now store the file via LFS and allow the push.
